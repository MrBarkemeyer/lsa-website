                <p>The nature of high school lends it to being transitory, people come to Lowell for four years and move on to bigger and better things. The LSA Archives are a way to remember that high school experience. All boards, committees, and other elected officials are archived under the year in which they served. Photos and other media can be found in each board's respective social media pages, if you'd like the whole event album please email lowellhssbc@gmail.com for access to it.

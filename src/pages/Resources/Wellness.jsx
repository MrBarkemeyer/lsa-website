                <p>The Lowell Wellness Team misses you! We miss having you drop in to say hi, checking in while you grab some tea or heat up your food, and seeing you shine in the classroom, on the field, and in the auditorium.</p>
                <p>We are experiencing a global pandemic that has changed all of our worlds dramatically and caused tremendous loss and stress in our communities. People and communities are rising up and using their voices to bring to light the injustices that the Black community, Indigenous communities, and other communities of color have been experiencing for generations.</p>
                <p>You may be feeling overwhelmed and hurt, or maybe motivated and hungry for change. Whatever you are experiencing, we are here to empower and support you in caring for yourself, finding and using your voice, and feeling safe to grow both as individuals and community members in our changing world.</p>

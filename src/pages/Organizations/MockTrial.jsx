                <p>The Lowell Mock Trial team is a program dedicated to fostering a better understanding of the law and the the systems that work within the US goverment. Given a simulated case by the Constitutional Rights Foundation, students may choose to be a witness, defense or prosecution attorney, a bailiff, or a time clerk. In February, Lowell competes against other SF high school teams to win the title of city/county champion, and then go on to represent San Francisco county in the state finals. The Mock Trial program not only helps students learn more about the law, but also helps team members develop the critical public speaking skills they will need to succeed later in life.</p>
                <p>Consisting of a group of students from all grade levels, the team is coached by attorneys who volunteer their time for this program. In 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020, Lowell's Mock Trial team became the city champions, and went on to the California State competition. Anyone with interests in public speaking, debate, law, or acting are encouraged to join! </p>

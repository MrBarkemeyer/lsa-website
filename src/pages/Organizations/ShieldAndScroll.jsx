                Hello! We are Shield and Scroll, Lowellâ€™s second oldest organization - an organization dedicated to helping Lowell run as effectively and efficiently as possible. We are an honor and service society, composed of the students of Lowell High School. Our goal is to serve the students and faculty of Lowell with outstanding service, scholarship, and citizenship. Regular duties include organizing and assisting the faculty and administration during school-wide events such as Freshman Orientation, Eighth Grade Night, Arena, and Graduation. In addition, we also perform various tasks (upon request) for the Lowell teachers and staff, from helping organize documents to assisting in setting up events. If you have any further questions, comments, or concerns, please feel free to email us at shieldscroll@gmail.com.</p>

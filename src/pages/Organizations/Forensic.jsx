                    Lowell Forensic Society is the oldest organization at Lowell and the longest-running speech and debate team west of the Mississippi River (est. 1892). We help students with public speaking, learning to debate, making friends, and competing in local, state, and national tournaments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our head coach and sponsor is Mr. Abad, a Lowell alum, holder of the California High School Speech Association’s (CHSSA) 2019 Donovan Cummings’ Service Above Self Award, and is CHSSA’s 2023 Hall of Fame Inductee.
                </p>

                    We have four styles of competition, which we call branches (Congressional Debate, Speech, Parliamentary Debate, Policy Debate). Here are a few words from our branch directors.
                </p>

                <h2>Congressional Debate</h2>
                <p>

                    <strong>Afterschool Practices:</strong> Mondays & Thursdays in Room 139
                </p>
                <p>
                    Congress is the branch where speech truly meets debate! Speaking in front of 15 other students and 3 judges sounds scary, but this is the event that will get you speaking well in front of large crowds the fastest. A skill that will be critical throughout school and the rest of your life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unique to Congress, you get to decide which side of a topic (we call it legislation) you stand on. Our topics address a broad range of real world issues—from housing in California to defense systems in space. You can even write and submit your own legislation for debate at tournaments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We offer bi-weekly online scrimmages judged by nationally ranked debaters, and we practice regularly with local schools like Washington High School. This is a standout event in the Bay Area and excellent for your resume.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practices are both fun and educational. We roleplay as real Congresspeople, call each other “Representative” or “Senator,” and earn gavels. (Not to be used as weapons!)
                </p>

                <h2>Individual Events (Speech)</h2>

                    <strong>Head Coach:</strong> Scott Pollack<br />

                </p>
                <p>
                    IE gives you freedom to express yourself through improvisation, acting, or original writing. Whether it’s duet acting, expert extemp, or heartfelt oratory, there’s something for everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practice is flexible, often done solo or in small groups, with asynchronous competitions available too. Captains and coaches are always there to support you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speech teaches skills that go far beyond tournaments. Our alumni from Northeastern, Boston University, UC Irvine, and UCLA often return to help coach.
                </p>

                <h2>Parliamentary Debate</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Directed By:</strong> Sylvia Nickolopoulos<br />
                    <strong>Captains:</strong> Shoon Mon, Sylvia Nickolopoulos, Winnie Liao, Alex Mangot, Katelyn Lee<br />

                <p>
                    Parli is fast-paced and team-based. You get 30 minutes to prep before debating against another team on a surprise prompt. We’ll help find you a partner if you don’t have one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Practices vary week-to-week and can involve joint sessions with Lincoln High. Parli is social, flexible, and a great space for growth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Everyone is encouraged to attend four tournaments annually, with opportunities to advance further. Our students have qualified for State, All-States, and gone on to schools like Harvard and Swarthmore.
                </p>

                <h2>Policy Debate</h2>

                <p>
                    Policy is research-heavy and argument-focused. The format is built on evidence, logic, and analysis. This year’s topic explores how countries should develop the Arctic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We compete at the national level—TOC, CHSSA—and travel to LA, Vegas, Chicago, and Lexington. Frequent travel is one of the best perks!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You’ll meet upperclassmen mentors, develop college-ready skills, and have access to alumni who’ve gone to places like Harvard, Princeton, and UC Berkeley.

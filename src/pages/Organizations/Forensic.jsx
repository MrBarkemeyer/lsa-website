                The Lowell Forensic Society, founded in 1892, is the oldest high school speech and debate team in the United States and also the largest organization at Lowell High School in San Francisco, California. The society's home base is in Room 135,  also known as "Leland Room," named after former Deputy Under Secretary of the Treasury Marc E. Leland.</p>
                <p>With over 200 members, the team travels regularly to prestigious national invitations, including those hosted by the University of the Pacific (UOP), UC Berkeley, Stanford University, CSU Long Beach (CSULB), and Arizona State University (ASU).  Lowell Forensics has also competed in the National Speech and Debate Tournament under the National Speech and Debate Association (formerly the National Forensic League, or NFL) for 40 years, making it one of the longest running national championship teams in the nation; as well as the Tournament of Champions, hosted by the University of Kentucky and the Tournament of Champions for the California Cup, hosted by Point of Information (the Parliamentary Debate Central Website).</p>
                <p>Coached by Mr. Terence Abad and the skilled and dedicated directors, the Forensic Society has been able to transform Lowell students into skilled, intelligent public speakers. Just over the past season alone, the Lowell team has "broken" (qualified) squad members into the elimination rounds of every tournament that was attended by Lowell Forensics. If you would like to join the US's oldest high school speech and debate team (and the biggest student organization here at Lowell); or just want to check us out, feel free to find us in Room 135, or, check out the descriptions below for specific event details!
